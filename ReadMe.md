3D RAY MARCHING SCENE

Rendering a 3D scene using sphere tracing and signed distance functions to an html canvas.

Includes signed distance functions for a box and a sphere and uses diffuse lighting.

The light source circles around the scene but the frames display slowly.
So a scene with a sphere, box, and a plane displays a new frame around every 2 seconds.
The box renders significantly slower than the sphere.
